You can use these\ncoefficients to apply the filter to audio samples. It also contains code to\nanalyze these filters, which is useful for graphically displaying their effects.\n\nAll of the filters in this file are known as \"Infinite Impulse Response\" or IIR\nfilters, because older output samples contribute feedback to newer output\nsamples and thus contribute to all future samples, although typically filters\nare design to reduce the contribution of older samples over time.\n\nLow-pass filters aka high-cut filters preserve audio signals below the cutoff\nfrequency, and attenuate audio signals above the cutoff frequency. High-pass\nfilters aka low-cut filters are the reverse. All-pass filters do not affect the\nvolume of the signal at all but induce phase changes above the cutoff frequency.\nPeak/Notch filters maintain the volume on either side of the cutoff frequency,\nbut raise or lower the volume at that frequency. \n\nThe number of old samples used in the filter determines the \"order\" of the\nfilter. First-order filters generally have shallower slopes, and second-order\nfilters generally have steeper slopes and can be configured to \"resonate\",\nmeaning they have a louder peak at the cutoff frequency. This file contains\nfirst-order filters and second-order filters, meaning one or two older samples\nare involved, as well as the current input sample.\n\nThe class FilterCoefficients is defined lower in this file. You can use it to\nset up a first order filter like this:\n\n\tconst cutoffRadiansPerSample: number = 2 * Math.PI * cutoffHz / sampleRate;\n\tconst filter: FilterCoefficients = new FilterCoefficients();\n\tfilter.lowPass1stOrderButterworth(cutoffRadiansPerSample);\n\t// output sample coefficients are conventionally called a0, a1, etc. Note\n\t// that a[0] is typically normalized to 1.0 and need not be used directly.\n\tconst a: number[] = filter.a;\n\t// input sample coefficients are conventionally called b0, b1, etc\n\tconst b: number[] = filter.b;\n\t// filter input samples, x[0] is the most recent, x[1] is the previous one, etc.\n\tconst x: number[] = [0, 0, 0];\n\t// filter output samples, y[0] will be computed by the filter based on input\n\t// samples and older output samples.\n\tconst y: number[] = [0, 0, 0];\n\nThen to apply the first-order filter to samples inside a loop, using the current\ninput sample (x[0]) as well as previous input and output samples, do this:\n\n\t// Compute the next output sample y[0]:\n\ty[0] = b[0] * x[0] + b[1] * x[1] - a[1] * y[1];\n\t// Remember the input and output samples for next time:\n\tx[1] = x[0];\n\ty[1] = y[0];\n\n2nd order filters are similar, but have more parameters and require more old\nsamples:\n\n\t// Compute the next output sample y[0]:\n\ty[0] = b[0] * x[0] + b[1] * x[1] + b[2] * x[2] - a[1] * y[1] - a[2] * y[2];\n\t// Remember the input and output samples for next time:\n\tx[2] = x[1];\n\tx[1] = x[0];\n\ty[2] = y[1];\n\ty[1] = y[0];\n\nYou can compose multiple filters into a higher order filter, although doing so\nreduces the numerical stability of the filter:\n\n\tfilter3.combination(filter1, filter2);\n\t// filter3.order will equal: filter1.order + filter2.order\n\t// The number of coefficients in filter3.a and filter3.b will be: order + 1\n\nThis file also contains a class called FrequencyResponse. You can use it to\ndetermine how much gain or attenuation a filter would apply to sounds at a\nspecific input frequency, as well as the phase offset:\n\n\tconst inputRadians: number = 2 * Math.PI * cutoffHz / sampleRate;\n\tconst response: FrequencyResponse = new FrequencyResponse();\n\tresponse.analyze(filter, inputRadians);\n\tconst gainResponse = response.magnitude();\n\tconst phaseResponse = response.angle();\n\nThat's basically all you need to know to use this code, but I'll also explain\nhow the analysis works.\n\nA first-order digital IIR filter is ordinarily implemented in a form like this:\n\n\toutput = inputCoeff * input + prevInputCoeff * prevInput - prevOutputCoeff * prevOutput;\n\nIf we adopt standard naming conventions for audio filters, this same code would\ninstead look like:\n\n\t// x0 = current input, x1 = prevInput, y0 = current output, y1 = prevOutput\n\ty0 = b0*x0 + b1*x1 - a1*y1;\n\nLeaving behind the world of code for a moment and entering the world of algebra,\nwe can rewrite this equation by moving all the output terms to the left side,\nand we can add a coefficient to the y0 term called a0 (which is typically\nnormalized to 1.0, which is why I didn't bother including it until now):\n\n\ta0*y0 + a1*y1 = b0*x0 + b1*x1\n\nThis is known as the symmetrical form of the filter, and it will help us analyze\nthe impact of the filter on an input audio signal. Here's a lesson that helped\nme understand the symmetrical form:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20200626183458/http://123.physics.ucdavis.edu/week_5_files/filters/digital_filter.pdf\n\nThe end of that lesson introduces a concept called the \"delay operator\" which\nlooks like \"z^-1\", which (magically) turns a sample into the previous sample\nwhen you multiply them. For example:\n\n\tx0 * z^-1 = x1\n\nThe lesson doesn't explain how it actually works. Audio signals aren't always\npredictable, which means that you generally can't do math on a single sample to\ncompute what the previous sample was. However, some audio signals ARE\npredictable, such as pure sine waves. Fortunately, all audio signals can be\nbroken down into a sum of independent sine waves. We can pick one sine wave at a\ntime, and use it to analyze the filter's impact on waves at that frequency. In\npractice, this tells us what the filter will do to unpredictable input samples\nthat contain a partial sine wave at that frequency.\n\nTechnically, you can't just use a single sine wave sample to determine the\nprevious sine wave sample, because each possible value is passed going upwards\nand downwards once per period and the direction is ambigous. This is where we\nneed to move into the complex number domain, where the real and imaginary\ncomponents can provide enough information to compute the previous position on\nthe input signal. So now instead of talking about sine waves, we're talking\nabout waves where the imaginary component is a sine wave and the real component\nis a cosine wave at the same frequency. Together, they trace around a unit\ncircle in the complex domain, and each sample is just a consistent rotation\napplied to the previous sample. The \"delay operator\" described above, z^-1, is\nthis same rotation applied in reverse, and it can be computed as:\n\n\tz^-1 = cos(radiansPerSample) - i * sin(radiansPerSample)\n\nMath nerds may be interested to know that \"Euler's formula\" was used here, but\nexplaining what that means is probably beyond the scope of this documentation\naside from noting that a complex number on the unit circle represents a 2D\nrotation that you can apply via multiplication.\n\nNow we can rewrite the symmetrical form using the delay operator and algebra:\n\n\ta0*y0 + a1*y0*z^-1 = b0*x0 + b1*x0*z^-1\n\ty0 * (a0 + a1*z^-1) = x0 * (b0 + b1*z^-1)\n\ty0 = x0 * (b0 + b1*z^-1) / (a0 + a1*z^-1)\n\ty0 / x0 = (b0 + b1*z^-1) / (a0 + a1*z^-1)\n\nThat last equation expresses the relationship between the input and output\nsignals (y0/x0) in terms of the filter coefficients and delay operator. At this\npoint, the specific values of the input and output samples don't even matter!\nThis is called the \"transfer function\", and it's conventionally named \"H(z)\":\n\n\tH(z) = (b0 + b1*z^-1) / (a0 + a1*z^-1)\n\nIf you plug in actual filter coefficients and express the delay operators as\ncomplex numbers with the appropriate trigonometry functions, the transfer\nfunction can be computed and produces a complex number that represents the\nrelationship between the input and output signals, whose magnitude represents\nthe volume gain (or attenuation) of signals at that frequency, and whose angle\nrepresents how much phase shift is applied by the filter to signals at that\nfrequency.\n\n(Note that in order to compute the transfer function, you'll need to do\nsomething about the complex number in the denominator. It turns out you can turn\nthe denominator into a real number by multiplying both the numerator and\ndenominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is just the\ndenominator with the imaginary component negated.)\n\nFinally, I'll list some of the links that helped me understand filters and\nprovided some of the algorithms I that use here.\n\nHere's where I found accurate 2nd order low-pass, high-pass, and high-shelf\ndigital filters:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20120531011328/http://www.musicdsp.org/files/Audio-EQ-Cookbook.txt\n\nThis page is how I found a link to the cookbook article above.
